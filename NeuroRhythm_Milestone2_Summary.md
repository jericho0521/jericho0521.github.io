## Executive Summary

NeuroRhythm+ is an AI-enhanced assistive system designed to help Parkinson's patients stabilize hand tremors through music interaction. The system combines a smart wearable glove with integrated instrument adapters to provide real-time tremor cancellation and haptic guidance, enabling patients to regain control and re-engage with their passion for music.

---

## Problem Overview

Individuals with Parkinson's disease experience progressive motor control loss, particularly hand tremors that significantly impair daily activities. Simple tasks requiring fine motor skills (writing, eating, buttoning shirts) become frustrating and often impossible, leading to:
- Diminished quality of life
- Loss of independence
- Inability to engage in beloved hobbies

---

**NeuroRhythm+** combines:
1. **Smart Wearable Glove** - Embedded with sensors and haptic motors for real-time tremor cancellation
2. **Illuminating Piano Keyboard** - Provides visual cues for notes
3. **AI-Powered System** - Enables hand stability during music playing

**Key Benefits:**
- Real-time tremor stabilization
- Haptic guidance for precise movements
- Therapeutic engagement through music
- Improved emotional and physical well-being

---

## Design Research Goals

The research aimed to:
- Understand ergonomic challenges faced by Parkinson's patients
- Focus on impact of hand tremors and motor instability in music playing
- Identify limitations of current coping mechanisms
- Discover opportunities for AI-powered assistive devices
- Explore therapeutic potential of music

## Stakeholders & Research Participants

### Primary Stakeholders
1. **Parkinson's Patients** - Primary users providing direct feedback
2. **Medical Professionals** - Clinical expertise on disease aspects
3. **Caregivers** - Outsider perspective on daily struggles

### Research Participants

#### Participant 1: Celine (Registered Pharmacist)
**Key Insights:**
- Confirmed severity of fine motor control loss in medication management
- Identified musicians as key user group
- Highlighted need for solutions enabling re-engagement with lost passions

#### Participant 2: Dr. Lim Jou Yi (Medical Doctor)
**Key Insights:**
- Validated device as complementary non-pharmacological tool
- Clarified musical challenges extend beyond tremor to include:
  - Bradykinesia (slowness)
  - Rigidity (stiffness)
- Confirmed therapeutic value of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS)
- Reframed design challenge: "enabling fluid, timed motor sequences" vs. just "stopping tremor"

#### Participants 3 & 4: Caregivers A & B
**Profile:** Adult children of Parkinson's patients (7+ years diagnosis)

**Key Insights:**
- Motor impairments impact ALL daily activities
- Playing music is insurmountable without dedicated intervention
- Most profound impact is emotional toll of losing identity-forming activities
- Solution addresses core emotional need for personal fulfillment

---

## Research Themes

### 1. Progressive Loss of Dexterity and Autonomy
- Profound impact on everyday tasks (eating, remote control, medication, signing)
- Loss extends to cherished hobbies (gardening, cooking)
- Leads to frustration and emotional distress

### 2. Heavy Reliance on Human Intervention
- Primary strategy: direct physical assistance from caregivers
- Low-tech aids insufficient (pill organizers, adaptive tools)
- Reliance undermines independence and creates dependency cycle
- Clear gap for empowering self-performance solutions

### 3. Unaddressed Emotional and Quality-of-Life Needs
- Inability to perform tasks leads to depression
- Need for solutions enabling reconnection with passions
- Music identified as powerful avenue for emotional and therapeutic engagement

### 4. AI as Bridge to Independent Living
- Strong support from caregivers for AI-powered devices
- Envisioned as bridge between clinical therapy and independent living
- Could enable activities with greater safety, confidence, and autonomy
